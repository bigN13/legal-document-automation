# Master Command Flow: 
A systematic workflow that reads tasks, implements with modular code, builds iteratively, and commits to GitHub
Build-Fix Loop: An automated script that:

### Attempts to build the project
Analyzes build errors
Categorizes errors (TypeScript, module, syntax)
Provides guidance for fixes
Repeats until successful


### Modular Code Structure: Enforces software engineering principles:

Single Responsibility Principle
DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
Clear TypeScript interfaces
Proper file organization


### Detailed Git Commits: Structured commit messages including:

Summary of changes
Technical details
File structure changes
Dependencies added
Testing status


### Automated Implementation Script: A bash script (implement-next-task.sh) that:

Creates feature branches
Runs the build-fix loop
Generates comprehensive commit messages
Tracks progress
